                            It’s a tricky thing, being a wedding guest.
                            Among the endless list of requirements – buy a present, arrange accommodation, practise your
                            small talk – there’s one
                            obligation that trumps them all in terms of effort: fix up and look sharp.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rules surrounding wedding guest dressing are as nuanced as they come.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are some obvious musts – avoiding white is always a good idea – and others that are
                            only acknowledged by serial
                            wedding-goers, such as steering clear of stilettos unless you enjoy the feeling of numbness
                            in your feet.

                            In the summer, things get even more complicated. Not only do you have to find a sweat-free
                            way to “dress to the nines”,
                            but you have to strike the right balance between playful sunshine garb and formal
                            occasionwear. This forces you to ask
                            difficult questions, such as “Is this wrap dress more ‘I do’ or ‘BBQ?’” and “Does this hat
                            make me look like a chic
                            French woman, or a dishevelled bird?”
